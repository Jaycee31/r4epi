# [R4Epi Electronic Textbook](www.r4epi.com)
This repository is for the R for Epidemiology electronic textbook. This electronic book was originally created to accompany my Introduction to R Programming for Epidemiologic Research course at the [University of Texas Health Science Center School of Public Health](https://sph.uth.edu/). However, I hope it will be useful to anyone who is interested in R and epidemiology.
