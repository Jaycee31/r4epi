["introduction.html", "Introduction Goals", " Introduction Goals I‚Äôm going to start the introduction by writing down some basic goals that underlie the construction and content of this book. I‚Äôm writing this for you, the reader, but also to hold myself accountable as I write. So, feel free to read if you are interested or skip ahead if you aren‚Äôt. The goals of this book are: To teach you how to use R and RStudio as tools for applied epidemiology. It is not to turn you into a computer scientist or a hard-core R programmer. Therefore, some readders who are experienced programmers may catch some technical inacuracies on what I consider to be the fine points of what R is doing ‚Äúunder the hood.‚Äù To make this writing as accessible and practically useful as possible without stripping out all of the complexity that makes doing epidemiology in real life a challenge. In other words, I‚Äôm going to try to give you all the tools you need to do epidemiology in ‚Äúreal world‚Äù (as opposed to ideal) conditions without providing a whole bunch of extraneous (often theoretical) stuff that detracts from doing. Having said that, I will strive to add links to the other (often theoretical) stuff for readers who are interested. To teach you to accomplish common tasks, rather than teach you to use functions. In many R courses and texts, I‚Äôve noticed a focus on learning all the things a function, or set of related functions, can do. It‚Äôs then up to you, the reader, to sift through all of these capabilities and decided which, if any, of the things that can be done will accomplish the tasks that you are actually trying to accomplish. Instead, I will strive to start with the end in mind. What is the task we are actually trying to accomplish? What are some functions/methods I could use to accomplish that task? What are the strengths and limitations of each? To start each concept with the end result and then deconstruct how we arrived at that result, where possible. I find that it is easier for me to understand new concepts when learning them as a component of a final product. To learn concepts with data instead of (or alongside) mathematical formulas and text descriptions, where possible. I find that it is easier for me to understand new concepts by seeing them in action.

["installing-r-and-rstudio.html", "Chapter 1 Installing R and RStudio 1.1 Download and install on a Mac 1.2 Download and install on a PC", " Chapter 1 Installing R and RStudio Before we can do any programming with R, we first have to download it to your computer. Fortunately, R is free, easy to install, and runs on all major operating systems (i.e., Mac and Windows). However, R by itself is not nearly as easy to use as when we combine it with another program called RStudio. Fortunately, RStudio is also free and will also run on all major operating systems. At this point, you may be wondering what R is, what RStudio is, and how they are related. We will answer those questions in the near future. However, in the interest of keeping things brief and simple, I‚Äôm not going to get into them right now. Instead, all you have to worry about is getting the R programming language and the RStudio IDE (IDE is short for interactive development environment) downloaded and installed on your computer. The steps involved are slightly different depending on whether you are using a Mac or a PC (i.e., Windows). Therefore, please feel free to use the navigation panel on the left-hand side of the screen to navigate directly to the instructions that you need for your computer. Important note: In this chapter, I cover how to download and install R and RStudio on both Mac and PC. However, I personally use a Mac; therefore, the screenshots in all following chapters will be from a Mac. The good news is that RStudio operates almost identically on Mac and PC. Step 1: Regardless of which operating system you are using, please make sure your computer is on, properly functioning, connected to the internet, and has enough space on your hard drive to save R and RStudio. 1.1 Download and install on a Mac Step 2: Navigate to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), which is located at https://cran.r-project.org/. Step 3: Click on Download R for (Mac) OS X. Step 4: Click on the link for the latest version of R. As you are reading this, the newest version may be different than the version you see in this picture, but the location of the newest version should be roughly in the same place ‚Äì the middle of the screen under ‚ÄúLatest release:‚Äù. After clicking the link, R should start to download to your computer automatically. Step 5: Locate the package file you just downloaded and double click it. Unless you‚Äôve changed your download settings, this file will probably be in your ‚Äúdownloads‚Äù folder. That is the default location for most web browsers. After you locate the file, just double click it. Step 6: A dialogue box will open and ask you to make some decisions about how and where you want to install R on your computer. I typically just click ‚Äúcontinue‚Äù at every step without changing any of the default options. If R installed properly, you should now see it in your applications folder. Step 7: Now we need to install the RStudio IDE. To do this, navigate to the RStudio desktop download website, which is located at https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/. On that page, click the download button under RStudio Desktop Open Source License Free. Step 8: Download the most current version for Mac. Step 9: Again, locate the dmg file you just downloaded and double click it. Unless you‚Äôve changed your download settings, this file should be in the same location as the R package file you already downloaded. Step 10: A new finder window should automatically pop up that looks like the one you see here. Click on the RStudio icon and drag it into the Applications folder. You should now see RStudio in your Applications folder. Double click the icon to open RStudio. If this warning pops up, just click Open. The RStudio IDE should open and look something like the window you see here. If so, you are good to go! üéâ 1.2 Download and install on a PC Step 2: Navigate to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), which is located at https://cran.r-project.org/. Step 3: Click on Download R for Windows. Step 4: Click on the base link. Step 5: Click on the link for the latest version of R. As you are reading this, the newest version may be different than the version you see in this picture, but the location of the newest version should be roughly the same. After clicking, R should start to download to your computer. Step 6: Locate the installation file you just downloaded and double click it. Unless you‚Äôve changed your download settings, this file will probably be in your downloads folder. That is the default location for most web browsers. Step 7: A dialogue box will open that asks you to make some decisions about how and where you want to install R on your computer. I typically just click ‚ÄúNext‚Äù at every step without changing any of the default options. If R installed properly, you should now see it in the Windows start menu. Step 8: Now we need to install the RStudio IDE. To do this, navigate to the RStudio desktop download website, which is located at https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/. On that page, click the download button under RStudio Desktop Open Source License Free. Step 9: Download the most current version for Windows. Step 10: Again, locate the installation file you just downloaded and double click it. Unless you‚Äôve changed your download settings, this file should be in the same location as the R installation file you already downloaded. Step 11: Another dialogue box will open and ask you to make some decisions about how and where you want to install RStudio on your computer. I typically just click ‚ÄúNext‚Äù at every step without changing any of the default options. When RStudio is finished installing, you should see RStudio in the Windows start menu. Click the icon to open RStudio. The RStudio IDE should open and look something like the window you see here. If so, you are good to go! üéâ "],
["what-is-r.html", "Chapter 2 What is R?", " Chapter 2 What is R? At this point in the book, you should have installed R and RStudio on your computer, but you may be thinking to yourself, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know what R is.‚Äù Well, in this chapter you‚Äôll find out. I‚Äôll start with an overview of the R language, and then briefly touch on its capabilities and uses. You‚Äôll also see a complete R program and some complete reports generated by R programs. In this book you‚Äôll learn how to create similar programs and reports, and by the end of the book you‚Äôll be able to write your own R programs and present your results in the form of an issue brief written for general audiences who may or may not have public health expertise. But, before we discuss R let‚Äôs discuss something even more basic ‚Äì data. Here‚Äôs a question for you: What is data? Data is information about objects (e.g., people, places, schools) and observable phenomenon (e.g., weather, temperatures, and disease symptoms) that is recorded and stored somehow as a collection of symbols, numbers, and letters. Below is a table, which is a common way of organizing data. Each box in the table is called a cell. "],
